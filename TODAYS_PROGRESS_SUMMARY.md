## Conclusion
Today marks a significant milestone in the flight booking project. We've successfully transitioned from a demo application with mock data to a fully functional booking platform with real API integration, user authentication, and database persistence. The system is now production-ready for core booking functionality and ready for the next phase of feature development.

The end-to-end booking flow works seamlessly:
1. User registers/logs in ‚úÖ
2. Searches for flights (real Amadeus API data) ‚úÖ
3. Selects and books a flight ‚úÖ
4. Views booking in their account ‚úÖ
5. Downloads e-ticket ‚úÖ

This achievement demonstrates that the flight booking website is now at a professional level and ready for advanced feature development and eventual deployment.
