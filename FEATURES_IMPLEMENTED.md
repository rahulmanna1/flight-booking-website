  - Retry mechanism with attempt counter
  - Detailed error messages with helpful tips
  - Request timeout handling (30 seconds)
  - Specific handling for rate limit errors (429)
  - Visual feedback during retry attempts
- **Files**: 
  - `src/components/FlightResultsSkeleton.tsx`
  - `src/components/FlightResults.tsx`

### 3. Recent Searches & Popular Routes

    - Airport data: 1 hour cache
    - Airport searches: 30 minutes cache
  - Automatic fallback to mock data on rate limits
  - Cache key generation from request parameters
  - Cache statistics and monitoring
  - Expired entry cleanup
- **Files**:
  - `src/lib/cache.ts`
  - Updated `src/app/api/flights/search/route.ts`
