## 📊 How It Works

### User Flow:

2. **Autocomplete**: System searches both Amadeus API and local database
3. **Smart Suggestions**: Shows matching airports with city, country, and distance
4. **Selection**: User selects from autocomplete results
5. **Flight Search**: System queries Amadeus for live flight data
6. **Results**: Displays real flights with actual prices

### Technical Implementation:

```typescript
// Airport Search Endpoint
GET /api/airports/search?q=dubai
Response: [
  {
    "iataCode": "DXB",
    "name": "Dubai International Airport",
    "city": "Dubai",
    "country": "United Arab Emirates",
    "coordinates": { "latitude": 25.2532, "longitude": 55.3657 }
  },
  {
    "iataCode": "DWC",
    "name": "Al Maktoum International Airport",
    "city": "Dubai",
    "country": "United Arab Emirates"
  }
]

// Flight Search Request
POST /api/flights/search
{
  "from": "JFK",  // Any airport code
  "to": "DXB",    // Any airport code
  "departDate": "2025-10-15",

}
```

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

1. **Amadeus Test Environment**:
   - Some routes may have limited data
   - Not all airlines included in test mode
   - Solution: Fallback to mock data

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Free tier: 500 requests/month
   - Solution: Implemented caching (10-minute cache)

3. **Small Airports**:
   - Some very small airports might not be in Amadeus test data
   - Solution: Local database covers major airports
