## Features Implemented

### 1. Data Structure Updates
- ‚úÖ Added `travelClass?: string` to Flight interface
- ‚úÖ Updated mock flight generator to include travel class data
- ‚úÖ Updated Amadeus converter to extract travel class from API responses

### 2. Travel Class Generation (Mock Data)
- **Economy**: 60-80% of flights (higher on narrow-body aircraft)
- **Premium Economy**: 15-20% of flights (mainly wide-body aircraft)
- **Business**: 5-15% of flights (wide-body and premium airlines)
- **First Class**: 0-5% of flights (mainly on wide-body aircraft)

### 3. Travel Class Price Multipliers
- **Economy**: 1x base price
- **Premium Economy**: 1.5x base price
- **Business**: 3.0x base price  
- **First Class**: 5.0x base price

### 4. Visual Display
- **Economy**: üí∫ Gray badge
- **Premium Economy**: ‚úàÔ∏è Blue badge
- **Business**: ü•Ç Indigo badge
- **First Class**: üëë Purple badge

### 5. Filtering Logic
- ‚úÖ Travel class filter integrated in `handleFiltersChange` function
- ‚úÖ Default filter includes only 'economy' class
- ‚úÖ Multiple travel classes can be selected simultaneously

## Testing Checklist

### Visual Testing
1. **Flight Cards Display**
   - [ ] Each flight card shows travel class badge with appropriate icon and color
   - [ ] Travel class badge appears next to aircraft type information
   - [ ] Badge colors match the class (gray=economy, blue=premium-economy, indigo=business, purple=first)

2. **Filter Sidebar**
   - [ ] Travel class filter section is visible and expandable
   - [ ] All four travel classes are available as options
   - [ ] Economy is selected by default
   - [ ] Multiple classes can be selected simultaneously

### Functional Testing
3. **Filtering Behavior**
   - [ ] Selecting only "Economy" shows only economy flights
   - [ ] Selecting only "Business" shows only business class flights  
   - [ ] Selecting multiple classes shows flights from all selected classes
   - [ ] Deselecting all classes shows no flights (edge case)
   - [ ] Filter count updates correctly when travel class filters are changed

4. **Price Correlation**
   - [ ] Economy flights have lower prices
   - [ ] Premium Economy flights are ~1.5x more expensive than economy
   - [ ] Business class flights are ~3x more expensive than economy
   - [ ] First class flights are ~5x more expensive than economy

5. **Data Integration**
   - [ ] Mock flights include travel class data
   - [ ] Real Amadeus API flights include travel class data
   - [ ] Travel class data persists through sort operations
   - [ ] Travel class data is consistent across flight card displays

### API Testing
6. **Amadeus Integration**
   - [ ] Travel class parameter is passed to Amadeus API correctly
   - [ ] Amadeus responses include cabin class information
   - [ ] Travel class extraction from Amadeus data works correctly
   - [ ] Fallback logic works when Amadeus doesn't provide cabin data

### Edge Cases
7. **Error Handling**
   - [ ] Missing travel class data defaults to 'economy'
   - [ ] Invalid travel class values are handled gracefully  
   - [ ] Filter works correctly when some flights have no travel class data

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Economy Filter Only
1. Load flight results page
2. Verify "Economy" is selected by default in travel class filter
3. Verify only economy flights (üí∫) are displayed
4. Verify flight count shows correct number of economy flights

### Scenario 2: Business Class Filter
1. Unselect "Economy" in travel class filter
2. Select "Business" in travel class filter

2. Verify flights from both classes are displayed
3. Verify mix of üí∫ and ‚úàÔ∏è badges are shown
4. Verify flight count includes both classes

### Scenario 4: Price Correlation Check
1. Search for the same route multiple times
2. Note economy flight prices
3. Filter for business class flights on same route  
4. Verify business class prices are ~3x higher
