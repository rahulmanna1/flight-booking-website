# Flight Search Results - Scroll Bar UX Fix

## Problem Identified ❌
The flight search results page had **two separate scroll bars**, creating a poor user experience:

1. **Main Content Scroll Bar**: From the main content area (`flex-1 overflow-y-auto`)
2. **Filter Sidebar Scroll Bar**: From the filter sidebar (`h-full overflow-y-auto`)

This double-scroll behavior was confusing and made navigation feel clunky, especially when:
- Users tried to scroll through flight results but accidentally scrolled within the sidebar
- Content could be "trapped" within nested scrollable containers
- The layout felt constrained and not natural

## Root Cause Analysis 🔍
The issue was caused by **nested scrollable containers** with conflicting height constraints:

### Before Fix:
```tsx
// FlightResults.tsx - Line 486
<div className="flex h-screen">
  <div className="...sticky top-0 h-screen overflow-y-auto"> {/* Sidebar scroll */}
    <FlightFilters />
  </div>
  <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto"> {/* Main content scroll */}
    {/* Flight results */}
  </div>
</div>

// FlightFilters.tsx - Line 247  
<div className="bg-white border-r border-gray-200 h-full overflow-y-auto"> {/* Double scroll! */}
```

## Solution Implemented ✅

### 1. **Removed Height Constraint on Main Container**
```tsx
// Before: <div className="flex h-screen">
// After:  <div className="flex">
```
This allows content to flow naturally instead of being constrained to screen height.

### 2. **Optimized Sidebar Scrolling**
```tsx
// Made sidebar sticky with proper scroll handling
<div className="...sticky top-0 h-screen overflow-y-auto">
  <FlightFilters />
</div>
```

### 3. **Eliminated Double Scroll in Filter Component**
```tsx
// Before: <div className="...h-full overflow-y-auto">
// After:  <div className="..."> // Let parent handle scrolling
```

### 4. **Simplified Main Content Flow**
```tsx
// Before: <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">
// After:  <div className="flex-1"> // Natural page scroll
```

## Benefits of the Fix 🚀
