2. Fill in the registration form with:
   - **Email**: Use a real email you can access
   - **Password**: At least 8 characters

   - **Last Name**: Your last name
3. Click "Register"

#### Step 2: Check Your Email
- You should receive an email from **FlightBooker**
- Subject: "Verify Your Email - FlightBooker"
- From: noreply@flightbooker.com

#### Step 3: Verify Your Email
- Click the "Verify My Email" button in the email

### 3. Test Resend Verification Email

If you need to resend the verification email:

```bash
# Using curl (PowerShell)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/resend-verification `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" `

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received?
1. **Check spam folder** - SendGrid emails sometimes go to spam initially
2. **Wait 2-3 minutes** - Email delivery can be delayed
3. **Check SendGrid dashboard** - Verify email was sent
4. **Check console logs** - Look for "‚úÖ Verification email sent to..."

### Verification Not Working?
1. **Check browser console** - Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Check server logs** - Look for API errors
3. **Verify token in URL** - Should be a long hex string
4. **Check database** - Verify user preferences have verificationToken

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: "Email service not configured"
- **Fix**: Ensure SENDGRID_API_KEY is in .env.local
- **Fix**: Restart dev server after adding env variable

**Issue**: "Invalid or expired token"
- **Fix**: Token expires after 24 hours, request new one
- **Fix**: Check if token matches what's in database

**Issue**: Email goes to spam
- **Fix**: In production, verify domain in SendGrid
- **Fix**: Add SPF/DKIM records to domain

## API Endpoints Reference
