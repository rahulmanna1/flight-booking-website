### âœ… Completed: Email Verification System

**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Phase**: 1 Week 1 - Authentication & Profile  
**Time Spent**: ~30 minutes

#### What Was Built:

1. **Email Verification Service** (`src/lib/services/emailVerificationService.ts`)
   - Token generation and management
   - Verification email templates (HTML & text)
   - Password reset email templates
   - Token expiration handling (24 hours)
   - Resend verification functionality
   - Integration with SendGrid

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/auth/verify-email` - Verify email with token
   - `GET /api/auth/verify-email` - Direct link verification (redirects)
   - `POST /api/auth/resend-verification` - Resend verification email

3. **Pages**
   - `/verify-email` - Email verification page with loading states

4. **Integration**
   - Updated registration route to automatically send verification emails
   - Added verification token storage in user preferences (temporary solution)
   - Configured environment variables for SendGrid

#### Features Implemented:
- âœ… Beautiful HTML email templates with responsive design
- âœ… Plain text fallback for email clients
- âœ… Secure token generation (32-byte random)
- âœ… Token expiration (24 hours)
- âœ… Automatic email sending on registration
- âœ… Resend verification option
- âœ… Verification success/error handling
- âœ… Redirect to login after verification
- âœ… Email configuration check

#### Configuration Added:
```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_key_here
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@flightbooker.com  
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=FlightBooker
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

#### Technical Details:
- Uses crypto.randomBytes() for secure token generation
- Stores verification tokens in user preferences (JSON field)
- Non-blocking email sending (doesn't fail registration if email fails)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Logging for debugging

#### Next Steps for Email Verification:
1. **Database Schema Update** (Optional - for better performance)
   - Add `emailVerified` boolean field to User model
   - Add `verificationToken` string field
   - Add `verificationTokenExpiry` datetime field
   - Currently using preferences JSON field as workaround

2. **Email Provider Setup**
   - Sign up for SendGrid account
   - Get API key
   - Add to .env.local
   - Verify domain for better deliverability

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Add verification badge on dashboard for unverified users
   - Add resend button in user interface
   - Show verification status in settings

## Notes:

### Email Verification Implementation Notes:
- Verification is sent automatically on registration
- Email sending failures don't block user registration
- Token is stored temporarily in user preferences JSON
- For production, consider migrating to dedicated fields in schema
- Current implementation works but can be optimized

### SendGrid Setup Instructions:
1. Create account at https://sendgrid.com
2. Verify your sender email address
3. Create API key with "Mail Send" permissions
4. Add API key to .env.local
5. Test by registering a new user

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Register new user and receive verification email
- [ ] Click verification link and get redirected to login
- [ ] Try expired token (wait 24 hours or manually expire)
- [ ] Test resend verification email
- [ ] Test with invalid token
- [ ] Test without SendGrid API key (graceful degradation)
